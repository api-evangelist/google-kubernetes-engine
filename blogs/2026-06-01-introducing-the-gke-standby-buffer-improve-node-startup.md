Application owners and platform engineers have long faced a difficult choice: spend excessively by over-provisioning to guarantee quick startups, or minimize costs but endure slow cold starts. We are excited to announce a solution to this compromise: Google Kubernetes Engine standby buffers. This builds on the launch of GKE active buffers earlier this year, a native version of the Kubernetes CapacityBuffers API that makes it easy to provision readily available capacity to handle traffic spikes, delivering near-zero startup latency for new pods.
